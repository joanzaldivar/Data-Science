P(A | B) =
"Given today is a cloudy morning, what is the chance it will be rainy"

- A is "today is a rainy day"
- B is "today is a cloudy morning"

P(A) = "probabiltiy that it will rain today" = ( 3 / 30 ) = 10%

P(B) = "probability that a morning will be cloudy" = 40%

P(B | A) = "it will be cloudy given it is going to be a rainy day" = 50%


P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
       	 = 50% * 10% / 40%
      	 = 0.5 * 0.1 / 0.4
